For compiling test_advancedsequencer.cpp and jdksmidi_test_drvwin32.cpp files you must:
- Set as search directory (for header files):
        jdksmidi\include
- Link with libraries:
       jdksmidi (in this directory)
       winmm (windows multimedia library: it should be already in your search paths)
